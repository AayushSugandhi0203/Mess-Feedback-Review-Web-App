I am a neat freak and they came in and made my house so spotless. It is such a breath of fresh air coming home and knowing I don't have to worry about anything! My house is so shiny and it even smelled good! You guys did a fantastic job and we will definitely be contacting you again!

Had the beef noodle soup.  I'm not chinese so not an expert but the noodles were hand made and soup was delicious.  I would recommend you try this dish.  Also tried the seafood pan fried noodles which were excellent as well, some of the best I've had in awhile.  We also had the siu mai which were passable.  

Overpriced for what it is but if you're gambling at the Venetian and you want some noodles, I would try this over the crap pizza and sandwiches they have at the other end of the casino.",,liJS3rpRalcZM4G-uHZLjw

I'm not sure when the current owner took over, but I just had the worst pedicure I've ever experienced.  I decided to get there ten minutes early (and I'm glad I did), because the seven minutes in the chair prior to my pedicure was the most relaxing part of it.  When the girl came over to start, I showed her that I had a cut that was healing on my big toe and to be careful, and within two minutes (while cutting my nails), she hit it and it broke open.  The entire pedicure was over within 15 minutes (and yes, that includes the nail polish drying), and the whole thing felt so rushed that I actually felt worse than when I came in.  I'll mention that the previous time I had gotten a pedicure (about 3 weeks prior), another girl had cut open my foot and it started bleeding.  I should not have gone back, but since I've been going here for years, I gave them the benefit of the doubt (maybe this was her first day) and went back.  I will not be going back again with these owners, and if they want to keep their business, they should take a long, hard look at who they are hiring, and how satisfied their customers are when they leave.",,hUgdQsMQPoNc3fa9VoMqWQ

However I ordered the vodka slaw and three hot sauces and it was so flavorful I got over the fact that I was eating hazardous animals scraps in the shape of a tube. The tots at first struck me as meh, as in not Orida tots, however the sauces I ordered - again - brought them to a new level of yummy. I got the momocho, Piri Piri, Thai chili and housemate ketchup. Not sure what was what because none of the sauces looked like any of the restaurant or jar versions I've tried before so I just kind of mixed and went with the combined flavor which was spicy and garlicky and yummy. The only reason for the three rating is that I would have loved some wings or another food option and the ability to rate 3.5 vs 3 or 4. Forced choice is not the friend of business establishments. In a nutshell, a definite must try at least once when you decide to cast your health and wellbeing concerns to the winds and dive in.",,D0YXykWUuvhUGVODr1nbOA

Deer Garden has a full menu and gives you a choose your own mix menu where you can select the soup base (they even have MSG free ones! I know, it's rare in Chinese restaurants), the noodle type, and extra ingredients from meat to tofu. In addition, it comes with a free hot beverage. And the almond milk is amazing (made from powder but still great!).

the 4 of us ordered 3 bowls of soup and shared among ourselves. And tell you what, it was very filling! The tomato soup base is a MUST TRY.

Overall, great experience would definitely come back =)

And while the service isn't top notch, (nothing new in Chinese places), they did serve in lighting fast speed.

But as a former Flagstaffian, the Bookmans in Phoenix is nowhere near as plentiful and varied in content matter as is the Flagstaff Location...nor does it have a cafe, which is a must for a bookstore I feel. Furthermore, the trade credit dollars given have shrunk in comparison to the rise in the price of books on the shelves anymore. I understand that this is a business needing to make money to sustain, but sometimes it feels like I am being ripped off on both ends of the spectrum. Furthermore, there are several items I have purchased and then been told, not even one month later (and upon losing the receipts so just trying to take the item back for a lesser amount in trade credit) that they are not interested in rebuying from me. I wish there was some way the Bookman stores would intertrade stock, so that the same books are not always on the shelves. I rarely find a science book that is unique to the stock on hand anymore, and only go in maybe once a month if that. I wish there were more used bookstores in the area of Bookmans, because if anything it would force them to stay more honest and competitive..versus the monopoly it holds on the surrounding area which results many times in a more lackluster brand of service and selection because it can.",,85ZmhXEsZ1JsGQ8VCs5Lwg

Goat cheese, pork belly, purÃ©ed garlic! Sign me up! We recently found ourselves on that side of town (directly across from the Knights baseball stadium) so we knew we had to go. This place is tucked into an alley so Street parking isn't all that easy; I recommend going ahead and parking in the parking deck. The restaurant is very small and you order your pizza pretty much the same way you order from Subway or Moe's. Everything is right in front of you and they just pile it on...my husband got the meat eater and it's pretty normal- nothing out of the ordinary there but why go to a place like this and get something you can get anywhere?! That's like going to Baskin Robbins and getting vanilla! I settled on the Southern Comfort...a sweeter Alfredo sauce, cheese, basil, pork belly and corn. Added caramelized  onions and the girl making the pizza suggested I put some Italian sausage on it - sure why not! She also said ""I know this is gonna sound strange but when it's done, let me drizzle some honey on two pieces and see if you like it"" Honey? On a Pizza? Ok, I'm game...what a game changer! Omg! Wow! I can't even tell you how good it is- I'm glad she suggested it because I would NEVER have done something like that! This place is worth the hint to find!

Granted I did not give the Cactus Rd. buffet a shot thanks to Yelp Reviews, I did want to see what Marigold Maison was about. Great ambiance and open kitchen, Sunil the head chef is always welcoming. Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening. My kids now say let's go eat at ""Andy's Place"", not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made. And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge. Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever. I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore...

A side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their ""dinner was good but they miss the buffet"". Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla...I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it. It's no fraud! You can quickly figure out which reviews are ""fraudulent"" and which are not, so I'm glad to see Bombay/Marigold Maison is in touch with reality and Yelp's value add to restaurant owners. Ok off my soapbox. Go to Marigold Maison and tell them a Yelper sent you!",,b5lVdfbzzE-RK_GeiSR6HQ
10014,,2017-11-18 21:07:11,,szg4VhzreMH42PINK-WTzA,,"I'm here to comment on the conduct of one of the tour leaders taking a group of what appeared to be mainly senior citizens on a tour through Red Rock Canyon Park today.  Their convoy pulled up into the farthest parking lot at the second parking area after you enter the park. The problem was they pulled up on to the side of the walkway right behind parked cars.  That is where my experience begins.  I was with my family and we were in the process of backing out with old people in scooters right behind our car.  It was not safe to do so but tour leader #1 encouraged me to do so.  After successfully backing out I proceeded up the narrow lane created by the convoy parked unsafely on the right of us and the series of parked cars on the left. The left hand turn I have to make is particularly narrow due to the tour leaders scooter parked in the front of the convoy.  Tour leader #2 is in front of my car and recognizes the situation he has created for me.  Rather than get in his scooter and move out of the way he proceeds to gesture his hands and arms wildly assuming the role of traffic cop.  I was distracted by what amounted to me to be an unrequested buffoon show.  As my first pass was unsuccessful rather than allowing me the opportunity to correct my angle myself this buffoon proceeds to come to my drivers side window AND PUT HIS HANDS ON MY STEERING WHEEL....again I did not request his help in any way shape or form.  Now he is asking me to move my vehicle as he commandeers the steering wheel to correct my angle.  My family is looking on with startled discomfort as though to think whats this buffoon going to do next?  He created a highly unsafe situation as a result of his buffoonery...

As I was leaving this buffoon decides to save his own face and announce to the convoy of disbelieving tourists that ""He Cant Drive"".... are you kidding me?  You come into my family and my life unwelcomed in the most buffoonish way, create a buffoonish situation and now try to launch a buffoonish insult to your paying customers?

I have not taken this tour would not recommend it based on my peripheral experience and would certainly caution anyone to place there lives in the hands of a clear buffoon tourist leader.  Ruined what was otherwise a lovely family day out.",,sqhLA00LZoWO7_lIVFlXpw

3) I complained to the server and the serve informed me that I had to pay the regular price for a new side of steak! WTF?!

It's a great basic gym with just about everything I need. I say 'just about' because it is on the small side. There's only one free weight squat rack which is kind of a bummer when it is busy (which it has been lately) and it can feel a little cramped. 

There are also little things that detract for me, like the fact that there are no 35 lbs weight plates, and there are limited weight plates in general. There are a ton of 45's but sometimes I need to only add a little extra!

Other than that, really no complaints. No one bothers you and you can get in and get out in a good amount of time. The staff are friendly, and always willing to chat or help if you need anything. Lyle is a good guy! I'd just like maybe a few more upgrades somewhere in the near future.",,pk-ssOyhQPnTZK1ERvuAgA

As others mentioned the a/c and heater issue, I'll mention it as well. Because they turn the boiler off and on, you don't have the luxury of setting your desired temperature. For instance its been hot out lately so the heat has been y turned off until November, only cold air is available.

I found it to be very pleasant and the staff to be very friendly. The inn was very clean and looked like it was a fairly new building. As I first walked into my room, the very first thing I noticed was how wonderful the room smelled and how clean everything looked. The room I resided in had a television, microwave, small refrigerator, coffee pot with complimentary coffee along with typical condiments, a desk, and an individual HVAC unit attached to the wall. My room also included a bathroom with the usual clean towels, shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The facility also offers free Wifi with your last name and room number as your access code. My surroundings weren't loud so I slept well except for the fact that I went to bed late and had to get up for work the following morning. One other additional amenity I partook in was the complimentary breakfast; specifically, I opted for the breakfast on the go, which consisted of a brown bag with bottle of water, muffin, apple, fruit bar, and mints.

The location this Hampton Inn is situated in is pretty ideal as it is about a 7 or 8 mile drive away from the shopping, clubs, and fine dining of Downtown Scottsdale. 
The shopping and fine dining is also just a hop, skip, and jump away within the immediate area. This is also an ideal spot for out-of-towners visiting to attend the Barrett-Jackson auction and Phoenix Open Golf Tournament that occur within the area in late January and early February.

However, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.

""As a regular you know we have an ""A"" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.""

She refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on. 

I show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that ""i'm not supporting her business"" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a ""B"" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.

Having never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?

At any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. 

Poor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.",,DssV9fskchomqfh7jeYavA

I ordered the cheese garlic knots for an appetizer. They were delicious and they were very generous with the cheese. They were small but you get six of them.

For the main course, I shared a slice of white pizza, a slice of sicilian white pizza with spinach and sausage, and a large pizza calzone. The white pizza was simple and delicious. The sicilian slice was perfectly crispy/crunchy, probably my favorite part of the meal. The calzone was extremely generous with cheese, I'm big on cheese so I loved it.  (10/10)

The Dessert:
I had the pleasure of trying the zeppolis. They were fresh baked and tasted doughy (in a good way), with a light sweetness to them. I recommend them if you don't want to eat something too sweet, great quality. (9/10)

The Service:
The owners were very friendly and welcoming. They ask for your name and remember it throughout your visit. Since it was our first time visiting, the garlic knots were free. The food we wanted was made from scratch, so naturally we had to wait it. There was a small mishap in the kitchen and they had to remake our food. They let us know the situation in a friendly manner. After trying the appetizer and the white pizza we decided it was worth the wait so we were patient. They gave us some zeppolis as compensation. Accidents happen, and they did a great job of making up for it! (10/10)

After watching the weather all day we decided, ""Hooray, no rain"", and made our way out into the neighborhood. After walking up and down Penn Ave and seeing some great art and listening to some music we needed some food. There are not a ton of places to eat up on Penn Ave, but the ones that are there are always so good that it makes it hard to pick one. I for one have never been to Apteka and have been eyeing it up for some time. Since we were close and it was an easy walk I was able to get us to go there. Right when we walked in it was busy, but the server told us the food comes out really fast and the turnover for tables is very fast too. By the time we ordered we already had a table, she was not kidding. We asked her opinions on some of the dishes, just because it was a bit overwhelming to look at the wall menu and then the littler menu by the counter. We finally settled on a small plate, two large ones, and a dessert. Very exciting stuff. The decor is simple and very nice. The tables were close together but the diners are friendly and we even chatted a bit with our neighbors to the right. They were long time Apteka customers and had lots of suggestions for the next time we visited. I like places where you feel that the customer base is so nice that it is easier to sit so close because it is friendly. 

Small Plates: 
Boczniaki z kapusta: oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb. OK. This was our favorite dish out of all the ones that we tried. My goodness. The butternut miso was fantastic. It was so good that we dipped some pierogies in in, some of our other bread in it, and just scrapped the plate. It was a really nice mix of flavors and blended so well. I would get this again for sure. 

Big Plates:
Pierogi: Z kapusta i grzybami / seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem: Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Honestly, I did not like all of the flavors of the pierogies as much as I expected too. I think that the sauerkraut and mushroom was the only one that I really truly liked. It came with a side of greens, some turnips, and I believe some crushed nuts. The greens were fantastic, the turnips were good, and the pierogies, they were ok. I liked the dough, I liked the presentation, I would have just preferred the one flavor over any of the others. 

Special Sandwich: Veg pate + smoked apple and chilis + red cabbage slaw + salt pickled turnip + savory sauce. This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. I would have liked a bit more of the savory sauce because it was so good! I think that it was the smoked apple, but wowza, what an amazing flavor. Next time I would ask for the sandwich to be cut in half. I had a hard time cutting it and it was a bit bigger so it was easier to handle in two pieces. But because of the fresh bread and only having a butter knife it was a little messy to cut into two. I thought that the veg pate, something that I have never tried or thought about was really great. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this meal. 

Dessert:
Tarta jablkowa: Tarta jablkowa z sosem z suszonych owocow. Apple tart + dried fruit compote. Again. YUM. This was a nice end to the meal for sure. The tart was crisp and the fruit on the top was delicious. I enjoyed the little drizzle of fruit something on it too. I would suggest ending the meal with this treat. 

The place was beautiful, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was great. I cannot wait to come back. I am so happy to be able to come here on such a fun Friday night. It really made the start of the weekend so much better.",,-hietrA8M58asfpyJkCyiA

The big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome!

I'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good. I think it's really good. I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious. Their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp I've ever had, their filet mignon is always cooked to perfection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it, it is simply divine. We also indulged in their chocolate cake which is always very tasty.

The reason I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got. From the very beginning our server seemed distracted and rushed. When she was giving the presentation she kept looking away like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else. I know you have the script memorized but that is just rude. Look at us when you're talking to us! Throughout the meal she would race by and walk away before we could even answer if ""everything was okay."" I was very disappointed in her lack of attention.

One bite took me back 11 years. To a very young man of 19 and his friends. Just coming back from a California road trip and stopping at their then favorite eatery. Ordering our favorite dishes, annoying the proprietor with our laughter and naive inconsideration (we didn't know better back then). Coincidentally, I bumped into one of these old friends there, this trip. 

I wondered whether the dish was good because of the memories or because it was just, legitimately, good. So a few weeks later I asked if my parents would let me treat them to Chinese. Bo Bo Chicken, Yu Shuan Chicken & House Special were ordered. The Bo Bo was tasty. I wish it were spicier (as purported) but understand that not everyone has a Chicano mouth like mine. It kind of reminded me of Ramen noodles, the instant kind. I love Ramen. The Yu Shuan was good too. Meat was dark so it was juicy and flavorful but was also supposed to be spicy and was not. House Special was great, again. 

What did the critics say? ""It all really good, mijo."" Success. 

I wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want the takeout variety of Chinese food. I recommend Nee House more so overall but for tasty, stick-to-your-ribs, let's-get-Chinese-and-watch-a-movie Chinese food, Dragon Palace is hard to beat. The dark, quiet atmosphere and great service of the place is a big plus to me too, so I say, eat-in if you can.",,RSpWZSdBox2Sc71Mmq_MKA

The wine list is accessed by a tablet left on the table which allows for several different search options of a very extensive selection.  Without the search options it would be difficult to navigate through to find what we were looking for.  As an appetizer we split the oysters which were amazing.  My favorite part was the fresh shaved horse radish that accompanied the dish.  For our entrees my wife and I both had the bone in Rib Eye medium rare.  We often find that many chefs have difficulty accommodating our customized requests for preparing our steaks but this chef did it perfectly.  We like them prepared Pittsburgh style with a small amount of Bleu or Roquefort cheese melted on top.  They were charred perfectly and still achieved the perfect red medium rare center.  The sides (we had garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms) were delicious as was the creme brulee for dessert.  

Last but definitely not least was the outstanding service.  Our server extremely knowledgeable and friendly and not over bearing at all which I often find in upscale restaurants.

I was sold the moment I saw the fried green tomato BLT online prior to visiting. My initial plan was just to stop in for a few pieces of chicken and some fried green tomatoes but ended up ordering a mini feast for myself. Going through the menu I saw cheddar waffles...CHEDDAR WAFFLES!!! with spiced watermelon and chicken. I'm use to the traditional chicken and waffles so I had to give these waffles a try and I was blown away. DELICIOUS!!! Adding maple syrup to the waffles didn't take away from the cheddar flavor mixing quite well. I glanced at another table and saw the mac and cheese so of course I wasn't leaving without ordering some also.

Funny story for kicks. I came to Yardbird after drinking on the strip with a friend and ended up going into the restaurant next to Yardbird thinking it was Yardbird before realizing it wasn't. Ordered drinks and everything only to have to leave and go next door. This actually gave a couple of staff members who were very nice by the way at Yardbird a good laugh when telling the story.

Glad I finally made it to the correct restaurant and will be paying future visits because those chicken and waffles are awesome.

My only con is that I wish I had known about them sooner! After years of frustration with both Cox and Century Link, I thought sub-standard internet service, terrible customer service, and ever-increasing monthly bills were my inescapable fate.
During my initial inquiry call, I was provided a thorough explanation of the services provided, along with pricing, and was able to schedule my installation that same week. The technicians sent were true professionals and worked diligently to have my internet up and running in a short amount of time. 
It's been five months now since upgrading to LV.Net and my internet has never been better.  I can easily say it's been five months of dependable and reliable service! My teenage son is also a gamer, so the switch to LV.Net has been a real game changer for him, his days of lag and limited connection are thankfully long gone.
The purpose of my review is to assure people that there is a better option for their internet needs! LV.Net is a locally owned and operated business which means when you call their customer service you get to talk to a real person in town!!! Not an automated machine, or a representative outsourced from another country, which is personally quite refreshing.

It has a very good size bar and dining area that I noticed right away even though I did take out. I wish I knew about this place during the freezing Cleveland winter! Friendly staff that offered me some samples of a couple of different options. The only complaint that I have is they need to add a bit more sauce with the rice bowls. Taste was great but got a little bland once I ran out of sauce towards the end even with mixing it up before hand. I will definitely be back to try the other dishes.

So we decided to go to this theater for Fathers Day weekend to see the new Incredibles 2 movie and we only chose this theater because the showtime best fit our schedule and it was very convenient seeing as how it's right up the street from our house.

Let's start with how dirty this place is. Popcorn and trash everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Outside, the lobby , the halls . You can't miss it. 
Our concession experience wasn't great and the main reason for my review. We were dealing with someone named Ashlee and then a rude gentlemen named Ryan decided to butt in and start arguing with us about the drink sizes and refills. When I tried to ask him a question he literally just walked away and decided to grab the customer behind me and start helping them instead. Probably the rudest customer service we have ever had.

I took my car in for routine maintenance and asked if they would have a look at the problem.  They performed the routine maintenance I requested and although I was a little bit taken aback by the price for the inspection ($100-$200 based on what they had to do) I have trusted them for quality service on other vehicles.  They did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  They went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.  As it turned out Nissan had to replace my engine.  This mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  After that Matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will EVER meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  He even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  There are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.

Although there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.

The building itself has unique architecture (although it would be nice if they didn't need a sign that asks people not to climb on it) and according to the menu, a great deal of history. The location is also great, being in close proximity to Old Town Shopping and the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall. Further, the first time I went to Los Olivos, there was a mariachi band playing in the dining room.

What I am forgetting in this review... oh yes... food!

The meal starts with two varieties of salsa and a basket of warm tortilla chips. I was pleased to find that the hot salsa was actually hot. I've tried the enchiladas and the burro (which is definitely not a burrito) and while both were tasty, I didn't find either to be anything special. One thing that did stand out to me was the Mexican style rice served with both dishes. I can't think of any better way to describe it than to say they got it ""right"". I could go on about the number of franchised Mexican and southwestern restaurants I've been to that screw up this basic side.

The prices and portions are reasonable, although with a group of five, all wanting to pay with plastic, it was frustrating that they weren't willing to split the check (and there was a sign posted stating this).",,AAuRwqCJZPYRGvPK_Mm51A

The large amount of unused space is distracting, and either some partitions or floor to ceiling fabric treatments could help create a more intimate feeling.
We went at lunch, and my ""bowl"" of fried rice, shrimp, and a vegetable mix was very good. I sampled the shrimp roll & ""Chaz"" roll of a coworker and they were very good as well. The service is good, if not a bit confusing, as the signage says that you pick up your order ""here"", but they seem to hand deliver all orders to the table.

No, it's not really about the prices, but rather the owner is really friendly. Like, you can literally have an awesome conversation with him. Out of the two times I had a conversation with him, I walked out as if I was ready to party it up.

For example:

""Yep, just going to buy this bottle of Tequila for my friends visiting from California.""
Owner: ""Ah that's nice, bringing the party to Vegas huh?""
""I guess, I didn't want to spend too much money on them so I just got Cuervo""
Starts laughing ""Not that good of friends huh? You know what? Here, take this small bottle of vodka with you too on the house.""

Yes, both the times I come here, he gives me a little extra. Sure, the conversation makes me look like a total douche, but hey! I brought alcohol for my friends from California! No, don't think I redeemed myself.

The place is small and it's located right next to Don Tortaco and Taco Bell. So if you need a quick munch, you can head on over to those places right after. As for the selection? There's surprisingly a lot of alcohol packed into one place. They also sell cigarettes too. Beers are all in the fridge, need margarita mixes? They got you covered. Vodka? A whole row of them. They also have SoHo, a Lychee Liqueur that mixes well. Usually, I can only find that at Bevmo, so that was a plus if I ever decide I just want to be a little pansy and sip on fruity drinks.

Besides that, I had no complaints and the staff were always wonderful there. About 3 weeks ago, I went to the Glendale branch and was appalled. Upon walking in, they have baby chicks in towers with feed trays surrounding the outside of them for them to stick their heads through to eat.. Only one of the chicks had escaped the pen and was teeter on the edge on one of the high feed platforms. Alarmed I ran over and asked my boyfriend to stand by it to make sure it didn't fall while I went and got a staff member. I grabbed a young man who seemed less than interested in what I just told him and was incredibly non-chalet. I then walked out to the back part outside where there were goats/pigs/peacocks ect. There were too many animals crammed into one pen and one worker was hosing (with a garden hose) down the pigs and goats to keep them cool (as AZ summers are 115). There's no reason to keep SO many animals in one pen, especially in this kind of heat. I was not at all fond of common pigeons being for sale for $2.00 either.

I ordered the Kung Phad Noh Mai: Shrimp stir-fried with bamboo shoots, baby corns, carrots and mushrooms in oyster sauce.

I don't have an allergy to onions, I just really detest them. If I can get something without them, so I'm not paying for something that I won't eat, I will. I think that makes perfect sense! Her response was that they just didn't put those ingredients on the menu! Ok, ok, I can pick them out (which is exactly what I did), but if they weren't on the menu, then they shouldn't be in the dish, IMO. What if I had a food allergy?

I've tried calling them twice, to find out about personal training costs.  Don't get me wrong, both times they were nice, but I have still not received any information from them, even after giving them my e-mail address twice.  I called and spoke with a gentleman a couple of weeks ago, and he kept asking me questions, but didn't seem to register my answers.  I guess he was reading from a script.

I don't like it when you ask someone what they charge for a service (which I did) and their response is, ""Well, what can you afford?"" or ""Well what is your budget?"" Instead of this translating to me that they're willing to negotiate a price, I get a used-car salesman feel of, ""We're willing to for you to pay much lower, but we won't tell you that. We'll find out what your max is, so we can push you as close to that dollar amount as possible."" I don't have a budget yet.  I'm sorry... how about you give me some prices, and I'll figure out if I can afford it...

The guy also asked when it was convenient for me to work out.  I work during ""normal business hours,"" in fact later, so it would be late at night after my kids go to sleep, when someone else is at the house to be w/them, and I'm not an early riser/morning person, which I specifically told him.  His response was, ""Well, if you can be there at five a.m. a personal trainer can be there for you.""  Why ask me what my schedule is and when it would be convenient for me to work out, if you're going to tell me who is available when I'm not?  I also had my weekend fully booked for my kids' activities, which I also told him multiple times, indicating I wasn't able to come in to talk to a manager, and that I would prefer they just e-mail me the information.  Then, w/out listening, he said, ""Why don't you come in on Saturday, or Sunday, 9-2, when my manager is here, or come on Monday 8-5 when my manager is here?""  Um.... it's like I was talking to a wall b/c I had JUST said I wasn't available during those times!

I'm not a ""lookie-loo"", but I'm not pulling teeth to get info. from them anymore and now have zero desire to go in and use their facility.  If they're open 24/7, they should truly be available 24/7.",,GaOInlwNUj-ZAQDwT8JGTQ

10257,,2013-05-28 20:33:56,,Hhq_WLopRJP83UxWI4qeaw,,"A bit disappointed in this weekend's visit. I've eaten at NNY for quite a few years, and after an afternoon of furniture shopping, and surrounded by the bit ""Mall"" restaurants, I was pleased to see NNY, so my wife and I went in. We sat ourselves and a waitress came by a few minutes later to see if we had been helped. 

She didn't know what beer they had on draft, odd, since half of what you sell is probably beer, and when my wife asked a question about a mixed drink she wasn't sure. I ordered the House Calzone, sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, mozzarella, and marinara sauce. My wife ordered the apple walnut salad with chicken on top and the dressing on the side.

The waitress came by to see if we wanted another drink. The blue drink my wife ordered was too sweet for her to drink another, so the waitress suggested the green drink on the opposite page. (East and West Coast, but I can't recall which was which.) The green one has sweet and sour mix in it, which gives my wife indigestion when it's the main component of something like a margarita, so she asked the waitress how much sweet and sour was in there. She didn't know, and headed off to the bar to find out.

The manager showed up with the food shortly after that and we asked her. She said they could leave the sweet and sour out, so my wife said that would be fine. She asked if there was any dressing, as it was supposed to be on the side. The kitchen had tossed it in with the salad. It was a very light vinaigrette, so she was okay with it. The manager left to put in the drink order and my wife noticed that her salad was missing chicken. She's watching me eat my calzone, attempting to get the attention of the waitress. She finally came over and threw the cooks under the bus: ""I put the order in right, they messed it up."" She went to get the chicken. And my wife watched me eat.

For a pizza and wings place, the calzone was marginal. It didn't seem to have very much in it. I didn't detect any ricotta cheese, but was surprised by a lot of diced green peppers, which are supposed to go in the veggie calzone. Not my favorite, but I ate them. While my wife watched. Eventually, her green drink came, as did a plate of sliced chicken breasts, which appeared to be straight from the microwave. Although they appeared to have grill marks, it didn't taste like they had been anywhere near a grill. My wife said it tasted like boiled chicken, unseasoned, and totally unpleasant on the salad. We go to Oregano's a lot, and their chicken marinade complements the flavor of the salad. This seemed like an afterthought.

Then manager was very gracious about the whole thing. She took my wife's salad off the bill, as well as one of my beers.

I might go back if we're in that area in a few months, just to see if it's improved. If so, I'll probably stick to the wings.",,4cz_92c2-Wu2MNBDPomblw

The people you sat down long after us order two sandwiches and they got their food quicker than us. The food was great. Eggs were perfect and not just put together real fast. French toast had four huge pieces. I order the everything bagel, it would have been good if they didn't burn the top. The food was great. 

The services was just horrible. And not even worth it. When we finished we waited for our server to come with the check and we waited around 15 minutes for her to come. We never got any refills or even check on to make sure things were good. It was hard to even get someone's attention. Three stars for service. Otherwise would have given five.

She calmed me down and explained everything in detail, what needed to be done, how, when, and provided a specialty photographer who took flattering pictures.

It was obvious they hadn't cleaned the table completely, yet the hostess just took the napkin, and I had to call her attention to the packets.

Basically everything was ok (not good). When I was done I decided to wait a few seconds and watch them clean the table to my left. They just picked up the dishes and napkins and wiped any area that was not covered or hard to reach. Since there were to big placemats they were not cleaned or anything and all the crumbs were left on them. Also the area that the check was on was never wiped, nor the other diagonal side because that would have meant walking around the table to clean the other side.

There are usually 2 large beer festivals that go on in a year. One of them is the Toronto Beer Festival in July and then this one The Roundhouse Winter Craft Beer Festival. This one is much smaller then the one in Aug but still holds about 2 dozen brewers compared to the 150 at the Aug event. 

The tickets in advance are $20 or $25 at the door (limited quantity) and you get a nifty mug to have your beer poured into. If you are going for the door tickets but expect to be there for 8am to line up for them as they will only have around 100 available. I arrived for 10am thinking I can get in but was shut down 5 guys from the gate. They advised to come back around 2pm to maybe let more in but was no guarantees. So we left, went to Real Sports bar for some grub then came back to again be shut down 5 guys from the gate (what were the odds). Luckily we were able to do some magic and was able to get in. Lesson learned, get tickets in advanced. If you do have advanced tickets then prepare to wait a while to get in as they pace the number of people entering to make the event smoother to handle. As well they have to check ID, give you bracelets and do a security check on you.

Once you do get in, you'll be greeted with a free toque and with someone selling tokens for the drinks. They are $1 each but sell in packs of 10 or 20. Most of the brewers are Ontario brewers unlike the Aug event has brewers from all over Canada and U.S. Most will charge 1 token for a half glass or 2 for a full, but here's a little trick, always ask for a half glass they will always over pour. Or just say 'be generous' and they'll give you more anyways. They always want you to be happy and to enjoy yourself. 

If you are cold then no worries, they have the Steam Whistle brewery for you to go into to warm up. There is a washroom there which is usually the longer line since it's indoor. If you want a quicker washroom line then go to the portal potties located to the left of the Steam Whistle. 

They have live DJ's performing with a dance area and lots of heated lamps or isolated camp fires for you to keep warm. 

I definitely enjoyed my time there and would recommend going each year. Just come early or buy your tickets early and get ready for the cold.

Chef Dick came out to talk to us at the beginning of our meal to discuss our likes/dislikes and also to tell us he'd be doing 5 courses instead of 4.  He was going to start us out with a cheese course to nibble.  Raphael carefully chose each wine to accompany each course and they were all perfect.  The cheese course was wonderful.  This was a special treat for us since our trip to France this year where we learned a lot about cheese.  Then came our appetizer course, scallops with pork belly, a very unique dish  - and I know I'm not describing it properly, but let me just say - AMAZING!  The salad course was just as unique.  It had oats and dried cranberries and was just so refreshing.  Our main course was exceptionally special as they served us Kobe beef with double baked potatoes (the best I think I've ever had) and asparagus.  Dessert was a trio of desserts: italian donuts (my husband's favorite), tiramisu, and creme brÃ»lÃ©e on steroids!

the closest major casino to mi casa; a worthy solid mid-scale bet; focuses on the locals trade with tons of slot machines; adjoined to a huge Bass Pro Shop, complete with massive waterfalls, lagoons, and fish (some of which are huge!); the Mermaid Lounge has the unique feature of a giant cylindrical fish tank that you can walk around and gawk at, and sometimes see human ""mermaids"" taking a swim; the small lounge / sports bar features an Airsrtream trailer converted into a mini-bowling alley; great happy hour specials (both early and late) at Twin Creeks steakhouse; the outdoor pool is small, but the surrounding cabana area is nicer than you'd expect; this place rates 3.5 stars, but I don't think it's worthy of 4, so they only get 3 on the Yelp scale; best craft beer bet = it's really lacking; the best you can do is Sin City amber & IPA on tap at a few of the bars",,sg3wRRtKMfugbO7A3AX4Ew

Here you will find a huge selection of food, anything from beef, pork, lamb, seafood and even vegetarian. Everything I sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find. For me the highlight was the Alaskan King Crab legs, they were perfectly cooked, large, meaty and pre-split. It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. 

Now the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive. It's also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening, the lines can get quite long.

What makes this place a steal are its food choices (some of its outsourced food) and prices.  I mean where in the financial district can you get a full meal (drink and dessert) for under $8? Nowhere!
I had their eggplant parmigiana with broccoli and rice, which was OKAY, and for dessert I had their cinnamon coffee cake with a bottle of Eska water.

Each month they have a wine tasting with Kim Hartleroad, make sure you come in for that.  For $25 you get some nice snacks, 3 to 4 wines to taste and some great lessons from a local wine guru.

Its very nice to have a place for evening tapas and wine as well as great options in the morning with Illy Coffee and Tammie Coe pastries.  They have a great place here, make sure you stop in, day or night!",,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw

Yes, you can save a few percent on tires but here's the rub: service in the tire shop is terrible!

Dear Morris Ramen,

I came to you on the afternoon of 9/8/17 with a slip of paper that held my full name, card number, and expiration date. Knowing you do not take reservations, after speaking with the host, I explained and wrote down the 3 customers who would be coming in at 7pm and that I would like to pay for their first round of drinks. (Written on paper with bank and customer info given to host.)

I arrive at 7pm with said guests. Table is sat, I order a round of sake. I am short on time and have to leave my guests before they are done eating. While still at the table, a server quickly drops off the slip of paper which I gave to the host earlier in the day with my card info on it. I ask the busied server ""is this taken care of?"" She says ""yes"".  
Later I receive a text from my friend that she had to pay for the sake I promised to have earlier taken care of. My friend says to me ""they said they don't do that"". 

It has been 30 minutes past with me calling your business number to discuss this matter and to offer my guests dessert as well as a fixed payment, and unfortunately, no answer. 

I am very dissatisfied with this. I stated clearly to the host with my name and phone number as well card info to apply to the check and to give me a call if there was any problems.

Truth. The drinks are very tasty! As are the desserts. I was actually surprised at how big mine was! Location is nice too

I understand this is Vegas, and DJ club music is all around, but why do I have to hear it at almost deafening levels in the dining room? Additionally, it's fairly dark in there too. I guess that adds to the, 'ambiance.' 

Service was very slow. Not to mention the server didn't look like he enjoyed his job. He was not friendly, didn't stop by much, and just didn't seem to care. It's not like the place was even full. The desserts and drinks were slow to come out as well. It was an hour and a half ordeal to order and receive two drinks, two desserts, and pay.

The upcharges. What? I have to pay for water? We're in the middle of the desert, in summer, and I have to pay you 2$ for water? (which im fairly certain is tap water) Per person. F that. If it wasn't for the Birthday (and the fact I had a red-eye flight 3 hours later), I would have ditched.

It didn't taste bad, just not freshly made. And it was served with a lemon slice on top, but the chicken itself did not taste lemony, only herby. The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes and while not bad, had a ton of green stuff in it, parsley maybe, too much IMO. My overall experience is what prompts the two star rating.

Okay, maybe there is, so as I was waiting for my $3 dollar change, I did not get anything for 3 minutes, so I asked the bartender, and he was like, I am getting it..... And he came back right away, and tossed it on the table like he was pissed...

We approached the restaurant a few minutes before they opened and they had diners eagerly waiting to come in, a great sign.  The diners decor is so dated but it works in a queen st west hipster way.  The breakfast plate is a great way to gauge any restaurant, and Swans is a little different than most.  First off they don't offer bacon, they offer pancetta, and weirdly capicolla.  I chose the smoked trout with a $3 supplement, but it was well worth it.  The fish was delicately smoked, and it was firm, but not tough.  The eggs and toast were standard, the addition of the broiled tomato was unexpected, and quite charred and smokey.  The potatoes are my favourite part and if they arent good, the whole experience is tainted.  The potatoes were reminiscent of a salt lick.  My sis also had potatoes with hers and she complained to our waitress about them, so she went to the kitchen and asked if they could do anything about it.  She returned with an excuse that all of the potatoes are made the same way and if they gave us any replacements that they would have the same level of saltiness.  This was slightly baffling considering we were the first guests, so how could all of the potatoes be prepared already?  Anyways, she suggested a side salad which was appreciated.  Another waitress first brought the salad to the table beside us, and than realized her error and put it on our table without a word.  I appreciate the solution however if felt very disingenuous.

My family and I have many great experience at this location including friendly service and great food. This time the food was not too great. My mom and dad ordered ribs that came out burnt and very dry. Of course they ate a couple ribs before making a complaint, which we hardly ever do. After I kindly asked the server to bring over her manager so we can address the issue to her, the service manager meghan came and agreed that the ribs were burnt and should have never made it out of the kitchen. She did not offer a replacement meal, instead took the meal and said she will take care of it. When we received our check, I noticed that a partial discount of $6.00 was taken off of the bill. I kindly requested the server to bring her manager back so we can address this problem again. Meghan comes back with an attitude and decided to argue with me about the food. She insisted that there was only a partial discount because my mom and dad ate a couple of ribs. I tell her that sure some of the food had been consumed but over half had to be thrown out and the total inconvenience should have been enough to take that meal off the tab. She decided to interrupt and give me a lecture on how the food should have not been consumed? I told her I don't have a problem with the $6 discount so long as she would have offered a replacement meal! She was very unprofessional, very rude, with a nasty attitude. She failed her job as a ""service manager"" and ultimately made matters worse. Her horrible ""guest service"" was an experience that I never had before, and because of this I will refrain from coming to this location. I'm disappointed it had to come down to this because usually the service and food is great.

It has that hard to find mix of excellent coffee paired with a comfortable space where you can either linger with friends or work on your laptop. The owner is a kind but no-nonsense guy who makes sure you like what he's served you before he gets you to pay.

The coffee itself is Australian-style, so you can get your long black, short black, flat white, and so on here. The owner-barista knows what he's doing here, so the drinks are done well.

What really puts this place over the top is the space itself. As you enter, it is immediately welcoming, especially because of the sign welcoming all races, genders, and identities. Inside, it feels like the library in your uncle's cozy country residence (if he had such a thing), but transported into downtown Toronto. There are newspapers and books strewn about the mix of tables, photos and paintings adorning the walls, and even a wall of diplomas from a variety of global universities. Most of the tables have outlets nearby, and the owner has placed handy adapter cables around the place so you can charge your phone. Also, as a side note, the ingeniously designed toilet/bathroom sink is worth a look.

Initially the loan officer was very nice and worked with me on all options. After I agreed to go ahead is when I started feeling like I made a mistake. It seemed as if the loan officer was on her own and didn't find things out till the last minute.  First it was the appraisal that needed to be done yesterday.  After the appraisal I was informed on a Friday that I needed to complete a very minor repair by Monday morning which resulted in me cancelling plans I had made out of town. The appraiser showed up and snapped one picture. A week later I get another $200 charge on my credit card from him which brought the total appraisal fee to $700. For as trivial as the repair was it makes me think that this might be a common practice to gouge the customer. Maybe the appraiser is related to someone at Homeowners? I don't know?  

When it came time to close there was no information on who was going to service my loan. I had a month before my payment was due and I was never contacted by phone or by mail. Finally I called them to ask if they would like my money and where should I send it, they did not know.  During this whole time I received letter after letter from multiple ""bi-weekly payment program"" companies they must have sold my information to. I gave it another couple days and called them back and asked again. They said a company called RCS would be servicing my loan and to send a check. First off it is 2015 and I don't have any checks because I haven't written one in 5 years. Second, even if I had a check it would not be there by the due date. I then tried calling the service number for RCS and it is 100%automated. Called Homeowners Financial again and they finally gave me a number to an actual person at RCS who told me I wouldn't even be in the system until the due date and I would be charged a $5 fee for making that payment  Which again made me feel like my wallet has been ganged up on by these people. Absolute confusion followed up by fees.

Their staff also seem very knowledgeable about what they do here, and are approachable if you have concerns. Each class is very consistent and is taught the same way, so, for example, if you come in for Topaz it'll be the same class no matter who teaches it. I've seen some people on here complain about that, but I personally like that so that I know what kind of class I'm coming in for that day.

Update: 7/29/2016
So in the time I've been working out at Arrichion, I have to say my opinion of the place could only improve!  I've been attending their classes consistently for about 2.5 years now, and thanks to Arrichion, I officially fell in love with yoga, got my RYT200 certification, and now get to teach yoga to little kids at my kids' daycare!  I also dropped from a size 14 to a size 6 and have toned up in a way I haven't been since high school!  The owners and staff here truly LOVE what they do every day and it shows!  You truly can't beat the heat here either...it's the hottest yoga studio in town! 
The only significant drawback here is the lack of showers. There is only one small shower room that everyone has to share. In the evening when you can go home stinky it doesn't matter so much, but in the morning right before work showering is a must. Luckily I can keep the workouts I love at Arrichion and use other options closer to work to take care of the shower. :)

The first for lunch, where I had the salad with tuna, hard boiled egg, oven dried tomatoes, and haricot verts and a GF peanut butter bacon cookie. The cookie was so amazing! I was dubious at first of the flavour but was really surprised at how much I liked it! If you're looking for a quick salad, this is a good option because they are pre-made with your choice of dressing on the side.
The next day I came back for breakfast with a friend. Although the experience was fine, I was a little bit irked with the service. First, we wanted to share the ""frittata"" and a smoothie. It is unclear on the menu that it's actually a frittata sandwich served on a roll. Being gluten free, my friend asked for a substitute for the bread -- anything without wheat. The girl helping us said we could get the granola/yoghurt INSTEAD of the bread, but when we went to check out she charged us for the whole parfait. If I hear ""instead of"" without a follow up of a price change, I assume it's for free and don't want to be charged for it. We ended up having just the frittata without bread which was fine. The other problem was that I asked for almond milk for my coffee and the girl said they didn't have any almond milk but could give me soy milk. But we had ordered the ""April smoothie"" which had almond milk in it and when I asked about that she said, ""oh right, I was going to make it with soy milk."" We ended up not having a problem with the soy milk, but I think it's dangerous to not mention it because it is possible we had a soy allergy and specifically ordered the smoothie because of the almond milk! We didn't mind the soy milk in the smoothie at all, but I think it is something they should have mentioned to us before making it.
I wanted to get another peanut butter bacon cookie, but they said they don't sell them at breakfast which is a huge bummer! I hope I can come back and have it again another time soon.",,DbQ-6iBDzi580Jq68uiCWg

Coffee-Not particularly smooth, a little bland, average.

Apparently, the store was able to restring (the 2nd time) the racquet the same day, but simply neglected to call and notify me. 

I should note that he offered to restring the racquet with a thicker main string (I use natural gut on the cross strings) for $20. That seems to be their cost for the string (which is really pricy and needs to be replaced in both directions). As I hadn't budgeted the $20, I will have to put it off or forego it until the next string. $70+tax for a restringing is really eating into my pocket money.

My new star rating is 3.5 stars, rather than 3 as indicated above. To be sure, I am a tough reviewer so 4 seems too high at this point, but it is not impossible so long as the store continues to improve their customer service and we see some improved planogramming. As a steady customer, I am looking forward to seeing the progress.

I would add another insight that I hadn't mentioned before. I really think the store has a good demo racquet program. For $30, they will let you swap out 2 demo racquets at a time for 30 days. At the end of the program, you get that same $30 off of the purchase of the racquet (in-store not online).

The only limitation to the program is that you need to put on your own overgrips to get an optimal feel for the racquet. Also, you don't get to choose the strings that go on the demo racquets (obviously), so you aren't necessarily going to get a perfect idea of how the racquet will play after you get it. Still, if you are a beginner player, strings may not matter so much to you.

Additionally, Wilson the US Open tennis balls are competitively priced at $2.39 each + tax and the selection of over grips and strings seems to be at least as good if not better than other stores I have visited. Additionally, if you research prices on their site and they do not match the in-store price, they are happy to honor the online price. Not bad for a brick-and-mortar.

The original review:

""I have very mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, the prices for many (but certainly not all) products are competitive (even versus most web sites), which is nice to have locally. Their sale items are usually not amazing. Not a great place to go for sales, in my experience.

On the other hand, you have to put up with an inexperienced, sometimes rude staff. It's a bit like going to one of those hole-in-wall/diamond-in-the-rough barbecue places. 

By inexperienced, I don't mean to say the owner/employees don't know tennis. They know that pretty well- more so than say a big box store. What I mean to express is that they are inexperienced with customer service.

A recent example would be a re-string I had done there. All About Tennis stores re-string information in the computer, which makes for a simplified process when dropping off your racquet. Because they don't always re-string your racquet right away, they store the information that includes your preferences. So last week I dropped my racquet off and told them I wanted the usual hybrid string setup. My father had to pick the racquet up 2 days later, as I didn't have the availability to pick it up myself (they close very early - 6pm, which is too early for a retail store). He brought the racquet home and I discovered immediately that the wrong strings had been put on it. So I called the store and they said to bring it by to fix the mistake. So I brought it back the next day, and they had me leave it again because they couldn't get back to it. The worst part of this experience was that when I took the racquet back, the owner/manager got into an argument with me saying that he had simply ""put the same strings on as had been taken off"". An obvious lie which serves no good for him. Indeed, his own staff (much younger) advised him that he had indeed put the wrong strings on the racquet. (By the way, these strings look nothing alike, so i cannot fathom how this mistake was made!)

So 5 days and a $55 restring - I'm not too happy about the poor customer service, so I will start looking for someone else to restring my racquet. At the very least they should be comping the labor for their screw up, especially considering all the drive time, gas, etc. that this debacle has cost me.

Separately, the showroom could do with a little sprucing up. Wouldn't take much I think, but some elbow grease would go a long way.""",,bLVW2XFVeO9GDmz-oTtYGw

I have been wanting for years to get some med-spa treatments for my aging face, but have never been able to afford it. The pricing of these student-applied procedures is very reasonable and they also offer discounted specials several times throughout the year for additional savings. I've become a regular here since November of '14 and have already had a number of services for just a few hundred dollars that would have easily cost me in the thousands at a regular med-spa.

Yes, the procedures are done by people who are still learning, so you need to be flexible and ready to accept some inconsistencies in the delivery of service. But it's a total win-win. The students gain real-world experience and you gain a better complexion. I certainly have!

So far, all of the student aestheticians have been women and they have been competent, friendly, fun and dedicated to doing a good job. They are seniors who have nearly completed the program and are thoroughly supervised by instructors who seem very knowledgeable. Also, since it's a school, they adhere very strictly to standards of cleanliness and proper procedures. If they err, it's more on the side of being careful. I have not had a bad experience.

The only down sides for me are these: First, I've had service done by some gals with whom I was so happy, I would like to have a permanent working relationship with them. Sadly, while you are able to request repeat appointments with a student while they are still enrolled, they do eventually graduate and move on.

This leads to the second down side which is, you can't really establish a history with any one provider and you frequently have to start over from scratch in discussing your skin-care history and goals. As a result of this I've also gotten some conflicting advice regarding which and what frequency of services would best meet my needs. But hey, it's a school and I am using it as a learning experience, too, so I can make better use of the available services. Also, the medical Director of SWINA, Dr. Laree Hooker, has a private practice and, for the price of an office visit, you can make an appointment with her if you want professional advice in creating a treatment plan for yourself.

I had a friend who owns 88 Express (postal outlet) and says that rent is pretty expensive there.  Thankfully the price of food there is still cheap to be competitive.  Being an Asian food court, the food stalls are all open till 8 or 9pm every day of the week including Sundays, and closed during a non-peak weekday (usually a Monday or Tuesday).

Oh, and I have boy-cotted the Taiwanese stall because they gave my mom bad soy milk and ripped me off in change many years ago.

There are other snack places on one side of FMP including a relatively new one that has freshly made beef/pork jerky (yummy!).

Comparing to Pacific Mall, I would say there are less stores, but a different selection of food court stalls (no more thai food at Pac Mall for example).

I come here very often.  Has everything I need except for a TD Bank branch (they have China Bank ... LOL!) and a Canada Post outlet (they have these just down the street at Hwy7/Warden).  Note that parking can be a pain sometimes during peak hours (weekends and weekday lunch time).

Although I come here mostly for the food court, there are other notable shops including an official Rogers dealer (AmCall) and Wind Mobile.",,kB9QPxar7HLKIpK7qeMnFA

Yet again on one of my lunch time travels I stumbled upon Used. Opening my horizons recently to vintage stores, I was surprised to find such a modern store with an extremely helpful employee :) 

On the plus there was no ""used"" stench in store. The stores selection of goods was impressive in the fact that all the pieces were unique and affordable (either used or the few new pieces). Unlike Geraldine's experience I found the prices to be on the reasonable side. I purchased a vintage silk dress for $19 that looks exactly like a Hermes scarf pattern. Awesome! 

P.s. Talk about helpful staff, the dress I bought had 12 buttons running down the back. Unfortunately, one button as missing. The sales lady not only helped me look through a button box she had at the store, but after a failed attempt she recommended me to a store about a block down the street. I went to the store and another helpful employee helped me find the EXACT button for only $0.65!

We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.

We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.

The service was casual and friendly.

In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.

Food/Menu:  My wife ordered the chicken kebab meal that comes with a drink and fries ($8.50) while I ordered the ultimate steak shawarma (sandwhich only $6.95, and you can also choose chicken).  We added 2 garlic sauces that cost $0.50 each.  Depending on how many people are there, the food does not take very long to come out.

Chicken Kebab - the chicken is seasoned well with great flavor, while the veggies and added garlic sauce in the pita bread compliment the meat.  The french fries are thick and are not too soft or too crunchy.

Ultimate Shawarma - the bread seems buttered with the right amount of crunch when you bite into it.  The steak, with the onions, tomato, and provolone combined make for a definite party in your mouth.  Tasty and savory sandwich.  This is a definite after party or late night treat!

Service:  They are family owned and do an excellent job of service.  No complaints!

Overall:  The prices were listed above due to the fact that you are getting quality sit down Greek food at a reasonable price.  I have not tried the whole menu yet, as I have not gotten sick of the shawarma.  Overall, this is better than average Greek food with a good price.

First the positive... the waitress did a great job, food came out sorta promptly. We had a large party 11 folks, the reservations were attempted on line, but because the group was over 6 people we were required to call the location directly. We were told ""the entire party had to be there before being seated"" ... we initially had planned for 5pm but told 6 - 6:15 was best they could offer to seat the entire party together. Everybody was there by 5:45 and the reception area was n9tified we were all ready... we were still on track for 6pm as a large party had just been given the check... so it wouldn't be long. Surprisingly another large party of 13 were told that the table was being held and would be given to the next in line if they were not ready. Not everybody had yet arrived, and the restaurant seated 5 of the 13 and the rest wandered in later. (Contrary to the ""all must be present before party seated"" rule..... special circumstances or they were buddy buddy with someone)  when one of the managers was questioned about lighting a fire under the party ""that had been given their check (now 6:05).. the manager said ""We figure an hour to an hour fifteen"" so they would ask the folks relaxing after another 20 minutes, and we'd all be seated at that time."" 
  When we did get seated (for a birthday dinner) instead of being seated together, the party was split between 2 tables across the busy aisle exiting the kitchen.....Los much for being seated together!  One would expect if they couldn't seat the entire party together in the first place they would not have taken a large reservation in the first place! 
 My serious recommendation if your party is under 4 people, make reservations by phone and still anticipate 20-30 minute wait. If your party is 6 or more, consider another restaurant such as longhorn, or outback first! At least you won't be appreciated as a patron. The initial service received by the 2 managers and reception staff along with seating arrangement spoiled the evening and dining experience!

-Staff stood at the bar while one pregnant server chatted about her personally aches and pains as we ate. Gross 
-That same staff proceeded to order her lunch in front of us for 10minutes, go to another register! 
-The menu is way overpriced 
-The tacos lacked flavor ie tasted like white grandma tacos from Minnesota where she found the recipe from a 1979 issue of sunset mag
- The presentation of the tacos- terrible. Just slapped down open face on a plate by that same grandma or from a prison kitchen 
- $8 mimosa on a Sunday, really?!
- No brunch specials or items of any kind 
- $5 small iced toddy- that price is ridiculous 
- Music was barley playing and what was heard was not impressive 
-We just left and walked by a group of staff and no, thank you, see you later etc.

I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.

Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered ""good"" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...

10666,,2016-06-23 00:45:17,,2UcIWzQr-DI8w1sgVJ8Fjw,,"Mixed feelings about this place. We ordered a recliner about 10 or so years ago. It still works perfectly well and has really held up - no sagging, all mechanicals working properly. I gave it to my children when they moved out as I want a power recliner and that one had the bar on the side. They had a 30% off power and leather sale recently. Since the chair I wanted now was both power and leather, I went in to see if I could get what I wanted. The power chairs with the different motors for adjusting lumbar and head as well as legs and back are wonderful and this is the only place I know that has those options. But you will pay dearly for that comfort. The chair I ended up with was over $2000, tax and delivery included, even with the 30% off sale! I'm waiting for it to be delivered because it is semi-custom but I anticipate it being comfortable. However, the reasons for the lesser star rating is some of their wacky policies. Since this is a chair, we were going to save money ($70) by picking it up in my husband's truck. If you go that route, they will still charge you $39 to have it delivered to the store. What? Why? That is ridiculous. When you discuss (argue) these silly policies, they pretty much just shrug their shoulders and say ""company policy"" as if they have absolutely no control - and maybe they don't. Because they are corporate owned now (changed over two years ago according to store manager), they will not (cannot?) negotiate costs for anything. I asked if they had a warehouse where we could pick it up for free. No. Also, even if I paid the $39 and picked it up myself, I'd have to sign off on it (after inspecting it in the store). If I bring it home and put it together myself and then have a problem, I'm out of luck since I signed off that it was perfectly fine. Um no, not doing that so I paid the money for delivery. Very bad business practice and nothing to be done about it!  The next reason for the lower star rating is their policy for custom orders. Their pricing policies are really arcane! I really wanted a bright red leather for my new chair and they offered it in a lower grade leather than the standard one on the chair I ordered. But even though it was a lower grade leather, it wasn't an included leather option for this chair so the custom price was $500 more for a lesser quality leather. Huh? They really make it almost impossible to make your order custom without paying through the nose (which I'm already doing - $2000 for a CHAIR?)!  Apparently there's a set of fabrics/leathers for each model chair that you can choose as semi-custom for that chair without changing the price much. But go outside that standard set and you're going to pay A LOT for the privilege. I decided on the wine colored red that didn't cost me any more money. Definitely NOT what I wanted but acceptable. The staff was friendly. Because they don't work on commission, they don't hassle you but they also aren't running to meet you at the door to help you out. Overall, I'm hoping I'll be happy with this purchase because I'll be able to make adjustments to my chair to make it most comfortable for me but I'm paying a lot for that and not getting everything that I wanted.

Food: The burger was very tasty and reminded me of the perfect cheese burger that I ate while I was in Japan. The ""best of both"" was tasty however the onion rings were cut so thin that they reminded me of string fries in a bad way (-). The smallest burger that I would suggest is the semi-serious (highlighted on the menu) as the $1 difference is a noticeable upgrade. I had a hard time finding my classic burger underneath the bun. The picture displayed is the semi-serious burger. The hamburger buns are toasted with butter and made me smile while I jumped up and down. Fountain soda had a good mix and I guess that the price is okay since you get a free re-fill. Other items on the menu wings, shakes, malts, and salads were not sampled. Good nitch as they stayed true to the product ""cheese burgers"". Fair warning $$ and the burger free toppings have a great selection from lettuce to tomatoes however; the premium toppings such as bacon (.99) and mushrooms(.99) cost extra.

Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh, especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state. 

My girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish, which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu, but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer, which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp, but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks, which was a little shocking at first, but it covered the whole fish, and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first, but as I got to the center, I found that it was perfectly cooked, and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite, and it was also delicious. 

Entrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad, vegetables, and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion. 

The place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two, you can make them on Salt Cellar's website.

My boar sausage was disappointingly lack-luster when it came to flavour.  The risotto was over-cooked, but other than the salt, it wasn't bad.

ATMOSPHERE:
Yes, this restaurant is pretty.

SERVICE:
They accommodated us even though we did not have a reservation.  It seemed like they just tucked us in and hoped the reserved party would come in late.  It worked perfectly for us as we finished up quickly.

VALUE:
Since we were disappointed with our meal, the restaurant was over-priced for what we experienced.",,8wAUfUc2a1CKmieq97zYdg

Broke my lease early only after acouple months due to an ongoing roach problem. Management insisted multiple foggings would resolve the issue but they kept coming back. Instead of moving out I tried to see about Management moving me to another unit but they would not work with me whatsoever. At one point, I came home after a fogging and maintenance had moved literally everything around (i'm talking the big appliances) without bothering to put anything back. Sure I get everything has to be moved and theres a waiting period but I found it extremely disrespectful that no one thought about returning after the waiting period to out back the heavy items. The appliances had been lifted a pretty significant distance from the wall and dealing with lower back issues moving it back alone was rough. I eventually got tired of waking up with at least one roach crawling across my face every night - I kid you not. It even got to the point where roaches didn't even bother hiding during the day. They would come out of the ac vents, the sink, the closet, and any dark space out of reach. The roaches have quite the life though. They get to live there for FREE. 

Documented everything which also included my intent to break my lease due to the inability to remediate a serious health issue. Manager tried telling me that I was not going to get out of the lease break amount. Of course they sent me to collections, not sure if my documentation sent to the collections agency or the Property managements company's lack of response helped me win my dispute but I managed to get the collection removed.

The third was a manicotti with house-made pasta, a rich cream sauce, with asparagus and pea shoots. A warmer and thicker dish in contrast to the previous dish. The pasta was perfect, soft with a slight tougher chew. A little softer than al dente which was good for manicotti.

The place is best suitable for a quick dine-and-go or take-out, as it is small and isn't exactly cozy. Muted colours, modern furniture, very clean and well-maintained. 

I've been spoiled rotten with great homemade Persian food so if I don't like your rice, I really don't care how famous your Ghormeh Sabzi is (which I am also terribly picky about because it's my least favourite dish but when prepared right, it's a star). Their rice is closest to what I've actually loved in a while. Soltani kabob melts in your mouth and it's far superior to their koobideh. Baghali polo is very aromatic and a single portion is quite generous, you may not be able to handle it with an appetizer. My all-time favourite Fesenjan was quite close to being well-balanced, if it didn't end up on an oilier side, much like the Ghormeh Sabzi. Both dishes had plenty of flavour to make up for it. 


Not a place to get comfortable at, but a great idea to stop by for a quick meal with friends. An ideal dish to split in a rush would be their appetizer trio of your favourite dips and picklings. It's enormous and bread is fresh. Service is prompt and friendly, foreigner or not. Take-out service is very speedy, regardless of how busy they are.

Did brunch on Sunday afternoon. We arrive, restaurant is half empty and are sat immediately. Sitting there, just sitting there. Hostess realizes we could use water, then realizes we don't even have a place setting and she was the one who sat us there. Anyways, we wait for a good 8-10 minutes without any contact from our waiter, only an apology from the hostess. Finally waiter shows up, doesn't seem that interested  and just asks for our order. As a former waiter I was mildly annoyed by this since its usually best to greet the customer, ask if they any questions and make good suggestions. My girlfriend goes with cinnamon rolls/bacon and I end up with the B&G Steak and Eggs with a Bloody Mary and coffee. We wait, we wait some more. OUR FOOD ARRIVES BEFORE OUR DRINKS? Then our waiter finally delivers drinks and makes blunder after blunder after blunder. I seriously don't know what this guy's deal was.

The food: Mine was excellent. Steak was perfect (asked for rare, got rare) and the cornmeal pancakes were an amazing addition. Blood Mary almost tasted sweet? Wasn't a fan. My girlfriend's sweet roll was tasty and gourmet tasting but DRY, DRY, DRY. Moral of the story: dropped $60 on non-bottomless brunch for an unusually poor dining experience.

We were greeted and seated immediately and handed the one page menu. Very brief and simple, not many choices. 

My friend and I both got a small noodle bowl. The size was decent, and the noodles were made fresh (very uneven though, some thicker and wider than others, and clumped up in bunches). The soup however... maybe it was my taste buds being altered by being sick, but boy, the soup was super salty, and tasted like boiled tap water...

Ok, the line sucks.  The parking sucks.  Doesn't matter.  One taste of the food and all that stuff melts away like the glistening hunks of delicious brisket melts in your mouth.

We tried the fatty brisket, pulled pork, sausage, pork ribs, and the daily special beef short ribs on the bone.  For sides, we got the beans, grits (amazing), and potato salad.  

All of the meats are wonderful, perfectly smoked with a peppery bark.  The beef rib was remarkably unctuous and flavorful.  The fatty brisket though.  Damn.  It's succulent, incredible, simply the best piece of BBQ I've ever experienced.  I literally am starting to drool as I write this review and am reminiscing on the brisket.

Oh...and here is a good tip...get the pickles.  They are fantastic and and provide a perfect sharp crispy cold counterpoint to the glorious meat candy.

The price is not cheap.  Doesn't matter.  They are using only prime meat and you can instantly tell the difference.  Their product is worth the premium.

Also, I can't forget about the good folks who run this joint.  Everyone we encountered was so nice and wore their passion for the BBQ proudly on their sleeves.  Special kudos to the older gentleman who was expertly orchestrating the parking lot & told us all about what to try and some of the history while we were in line, and also the guy working the smokers.  He invited my wife back to show her the process he uses with the brisket, what an awesome treat!

- Camarones/shrimp tacos: 3/5, shrimp has a batter that was already soft and soaked in oil. Avocados were old and mushy. 

- Tripas taco: 2/5: Not as good as other places that I've had tripas from. The tripas came out crispy but it was burnt and fatty. 

- Asada tacos: 3/5: the meat had very little flavor and tasted bland. Relied on limes and hot sauces to help it out.

Unlike a true upscale restaurant you order as you come in the door. The menu is written on table paper and pinned to the wall. After you order you have to walk around and find an available table. We were fortunate that we found one fairly quickly. 

Meals: bland. Because I am unfamiliar with the type of food Apteka serves I  ordered the 2nd dish on the large plates and had my partner order the peorogies. I was surprised that my meal was actually a salad. Why would I go to a vegan restaurant to order a salad when I can get that anywhere...this is what my friends said when my order came. The salad was good but not great.  My partner shared his meal with me but the sauce tasted sour so I didn't like it. 

Cons: I don't like ordering my dinner at a counter, grabbing my silverware and finding my own table in this type of restaurant. While the servers, or food runners, were pleasant they did not come back to check on you. 

Positives: the service and atmosphere. The food came quickly and the atmosphere was great although a little too dark for my liking. 

I am truly upset that I cannot support my community of vegans but this is not an establishment that I nor my friends would visit again. For a true pleasant vegan experience I'll go back to the Doublewide Grill.",,TExj5cyhpYqe-zPKWGQaNA

We saw the PDX version (Premium Digital Experience) which, according to what they told us at the ticket counter, was better sound and 3D effects. The only thing that was intense (in a good way) about it was the sound was better, but the picture part of it was not worth the $38 that we paid for.  $38 for one adult and two kids....totally not worth it. Plus, the price for food at theaters now is absolutely ridiculous!!!  For the three of us, including the cost of the tickets was over $65. It pretty much costs as much as dinner would cost at a 5-Star restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the movie. The movie was great, very suspenseful.

The first time I went the ever so popular store known for their stationary, the majority of it was gone and the touch screen gloves were sold out, something which I was hoping to buy. 

The second time I ended up buying erasers as I lost my erasers. I know it may sound silly to write a review on erasers but I was pretty upset when I lost mine and they work well compared to other erasers I've used. I ended up buying a few of them for fear I may lose them again and it's very common for erasers to go missing. 

However, something I was disappointed about was the fact they did not have the touch screen gloves again. They told me they were sold out before Christmas break which to me was a while ago. It's February now. It could be the shipping and handling but if something was sold out that fast, you would think they'd restock again soon.

The coolest part about the store in my opinion was the stamping station where you get to design the simplicity of the notebooks.

Little did I know that I was coming on the same night as the NBA finals last game.  I don't follow hoops.  So I was kind of frustrated when they switched the channels from a baseball game and a hockey game I was watching in favor of the NBA finals.  How dare they!  But nobody else seemed to mind so oviously I was in the minority.  Regardless, I was here for a sandwich.  Not sports.  And a sandwich I got.  It was not the kind of Reuben I was craving.  The sliced thin and stacked tall beef with cheese, sauerkraut and dressing like at Jason's Deli.  It was thicker sliced beef and not stacked as high as I wanted.  Still, this was a good sandwich.  Great flavor. Plenty filling.  Dry rye bread with just the right amount of dressing to help it down the gullet.  Actually more cheesey than what I had wanted.  And that is not a bad thing.  Cheese is good friend of mine.  Although this was not what I had pictured in my mind,  I did not leave disappointed.  And that is a win in my book.  Also, the coleslaw on the side was respectable.  Not the best slaw I've had but nothing to scoff at.  Service was also commendable. I was seen by at least four people.  One who took my drink order.  One who took my food order.  One who brought my food to the table.  And one who removed my empty plate.  They were mostly quick to my table.  And friendly.

Best of all, Gaetano's is in our neighborhood!  The food has great flavor. Meats are always served to our desired doneness. Seafood and poultry items on the menu are juicy and tender. Pasta is cooked al dente while the sauces always make me want to lick my plate clean!  I love listening to their specials although you can't go wrong ordering from the menu. I recommend the burrata, the baked artichoke stuffed with Parmesan (an occasional special), the mushroom soup (also a special) and caprese for starters, the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini for pasta, and the Ossobuco alla Milanese for your entree, the tiramisu for dessert paired with THE cappuccino (not the regular one but the owner's own recipe).  Then again, like I said, you can't go wrong with any item from the menu.

I most especially like the feeling that the restaurant exudes.  You can certainly feel the welcome from the family that runs the place. The service is very personal. Nick who is often our server, treats us very well.  I also enjoy small talks with his father who is usually the host for the evening when he comes around to the tables. The floor plan and lighting make you feel cozy. It is not too small as to constrict you nor is it too big that it loses the intimacy.  I can come in shorts and flip-flops or in a little black satin dress and I'd be fine.  They send you a gift certificate for a free dinner to celebrate your birthday which is redeemable within your birth month. They often email you discount coupons too.  Occasionally, the restaurant will have set dinner menu pairing events hosted by wineries which are well worth the price because they are often generous with their pours and with pour refills.

They apologize for problems and then just stand there rather than proactively trying to come up with a solution.  They excelled at blank smiles and standing still.

The wi-fi signal was weak, totally unavailable in one of our rooms, and in the room that did get a signal, the connection was unreliable and tech support was tedious.

We had enjoyed great meals just about every time we visited.  However, like other posters, it was confusing to have three or four people coming by the table.  Also, one reviewer referred to the female manager as 'a bitch'.  That's a bit stronger word than I would have used, but I knew immediately who she was talking about.  During our last visit many months ago, my wife's hamburger that was ordered medium rare was delivered with a cold, bleeding center.  No big deal, we flagged down one of the multiple people that had visited our table and asked them to cook it a bit more.  We were very reluctant to do this because it had boursin cheese on top and we just didn't know how it would come back.  It came back medium well with no pink in the center.  The aforementioned female manager came by to see how things were and we expressed our disappointment.  She explained to us that the cook had recently moved here from New York and '...he was still learning how to cook for people in North Carolina.'  Huh?  After this comment sank in for a few minutes, it got me a bit ticked off.  My wife and I have both eaten in New York plenty and they cook meat the same way we have requested it all over the country, including North Carolina.  The manager also told us that she checked the burger when it was first sent back and that it was cooked the way it was ordered.  Well, admittedly, we asked for medium rare and that isn't a long way from rare, but we got extra rare.  Anyone would have sent that burger back, I think.

So, according to this 'manager', either the cook prepared the burger correctly and we were wrong, or we were idiots from North Carolina that didn't know how to order our food, as far as we could tell.  Since that visit, we have never returned and we will not go back as long as that woman is there.  We have stopped bragging about the place and now, instead, relate our last experience.  Others have shared similar opinions with us.  Recently, at Christmas in Davidson, we were cruising the food vendor tents and saw her manning the Toast tent.  Too bad, we would have loved to pick up something there, but there was no way I was going to give that woman any of my money.

10895,,2015-01-18 15:26:25,,-gLwYZW2gk1CpDoaDlvwew,,"The start of the new year also means the start of Happening Gourmand in the old port. This food ""festival"" brings together all the restaurants of the Antonopoulos Group and provides a special reduced price table d'hÃ´te at each of their 8 restaurants. Events like these are enjoyable for me simply because it allows me to try Old Port restaurants without costing me my arm and perhaps a leg to enjoy. Ironically this year, I wasn't a driving force amongst my friends to participate as is usually the case... two separate friends set up two reservations and invited me! I guess this is a sign of the event gaining a foothold in people's consciousness. Either way, I won't turn down a good meal so away I went. The first of the two dinners was at Taverne Gaspar - the Group's Gastropup located on de la Commune with a view of the Saint-Lawrence.

Visually, Taverne Gaspar attempts to blend the pub or tavern look with elements of the old Montreal building it is located in - a nice long wooden bar with wooden seats, leather banquettes and chairs, tile flooring and roofing, low lighting with the exception of the christmas lights set up along the center of the room. That choice along with the use of dark tones elsewhere to put emphasis on the old stone walls creates a very relaxed old world kind of feel. The night we were there the entire street actually lost power so at one point for a bit, the lighting was almost completely candlelight so that intimate feel was cranked up further! Thankfully the lost power didn't affect our meal...

Now, as for the food, the menu is definitely gastropub fare with touches of more local influences. As a group of 3, we each picked something different in order to try as much as we could. First up, a classic onion soup - a hardy and meaty broth with good quantity of onions nicely caramelized topped with gooey cheese and a crouton. Well very executed and enjoyable.

I also had some fresh oysters because I'm a sucker of oysters so if they're on the menu, it's hard for me to resist. Paired with a nice mignonette, there were great.

Next, we had the lobster sliders with house chips. Firstly, when the menu says sliders, we would have expected more than one but no... just one. Thankfully it was pretty flavourful although I would have prefer more lobster versus mayo. The house chips were nicely seasoned with a good crunch. The salad felt like it was there to make the dish seem larger. A solid dish flavour-wise but disappointing in terms of portion - especially when this was a dish where they charged extra for it within the table d'hÃ´te.

The last starter was their beef poutine with cheese curds and cipollini sauce. In my eyes, this was the best of the bunch. The beef was rich and fall apart in texture and in combination with the cipollini sauce, gave the poutine a much hefty feel than your standard poutine. Add solid fries and the correct cheese curds - melt just a bit but still keep its texture and squeak - and we have a great starter.

Moving on the mains, the first one was their beef bourguignon. Once again great texture to the beef - chewy but fall apart. Carrots and potatoes cooked nicely as well but that reduced sauce was really the key here. Brought everything together and really made the dish nice and hearty - exactly what one seeks in a beef bourguignon.

Next was the mac n'cheese with cheddar and smoked lardons. Baked off nicely in a onion soup dish, the cheddar brought some sharpness to the creamy gooeyness that is mac n'cheese and of course the fattiness of the lardons was well appreciated. A solid dish.

The last main was the Gaspar BBQ burger with their house fries - another dish where they charged extra for but thankfully in this case it was worth it. Portion-wise this was by far the biggest and enjoyable across the board. More of the house fries plus a side of coleslaw to go with the burger. The beef patty was cooked perfectly topped with some melted cheese, bacon and slaw. A little spicy mayo was provided to go with the fries as well. Another solid dish to round off the second course.

Finally, we had the desserts. The table d'hÃ´te provided two options - chantilly brownies and a bumble berry cheesecake. The brownies were decadent and very chocolatey. The chantilly cream provided a nice counterbalance to that. The cheesecake was nice as well - the right level of creaminess without being too rich. Solid way to end our meal.

Overall, Taverne Gaspar was a solid and well executed meal pretty much across the board. I'm not a big fan of how they charge extra on certain dishes within the table d'hote especially when they are some of the more appealing options there but I suppose it was just up to us to not order them. I like the vibe of the setting and the quality of the food on the menu. If one is seeking a worthwhile gastropub in Old Montreal, Gaspar is worth your consideration.

Cheers!",,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw
10896,,2016-01-30 03:39:23,,tGhjd1XNBzWXVfLUvUXeug,,"Menu: http://www.ruelo.com/ (Includes cakes and macarons list, they have more stuff at the location.)

What we had: various flavours of macarons, Ruelo cake, green tea red bean sesame cake, strawberry yuzu cake, white chocolate lemon cake (not listed on their website)

Taste: 10/10

Can we give 11/10? We absolutely love their cakes, especially the Ruelo cake. That's our favourite cake in the whole world. It's like Ferrero Rocher made into a super decadent cake. Their cakes are consistent masterpieces and look elegant. Their website has descriptions of the cakes so we will not go into detail in our review. The only cake that we weren't big on was the green tea red bean sesame cake because it was not sweet enough for our taste. If you like a cake that's very light tasting and has low sweetness, you may like the green tea cake.
 
The macarons here are good as well; the Ruelo macaron is Laura's favourite. One of the more recent flavours we've tried is the strawberry yogurt, which had the yogurty tartness and was interesting. We really really really want to try the Cream Cheese Orange flavour, but we never see it available in store. :( 

Value: 5/10

Not going to lie, the goods are expensive. Like we've said about the other location: 
The servings they list on their website are waaaaaaaay off. The small cake is supposed to serve 6-8 people? More like 6-8 mice, and that's being generous. We can each decimate a 5' mango almond cake on our own. (Not proud of it, but true facts.) That being said, their cake prices are cheaper and tastier than Nadege, and their single serving cakes are not too expensive (around $6, forget exact price). 

Service/Convenience: 8/10

This location is in Time Square, and if you've been there, you know that finding parking is almost impossible. Once you manage to find parking, finding the store front is easy. We never tried their afternoon tea thing, but from the times we bought cakes and macarons, the staff here are very friendly and efficient.

When we came here to get Laura's bday cake, the staff did not have a cake available but they were very accomodating; they were able to assemble the cake in 15 minutes.

Would go back? Yes, this is Laura's go-to cake store for special occasions. 

Would recommend to friend? Yes, the cakes, and macarons if the friend is into macarons.

I was in need of a color and cut, and knew I had to start locating a new stylist. Being in my sixties, I knew this was not an easy task, coupled with the fact I wanted to cut my hair short for lower maintenance.

After conducting research on Yelp, I found Tonia. I called, and immediately was impressed from the start. I set up the appointment, and was not sure if I was ready for a new hairstyle. My fear was looking like the woman my age who have short hair and look matronly and frumpy. 

Upon meeting Tonia, I found her to be a beautiful, funny, smart, and interesting woman; it would be easy to sit in a chair in her presence for a few hours. I discussed my hesitant desire to cut my hair short. She asked me several questions (a subtle interrogation I learned, as she is no dummy---not smart to cut someones hair off short and be dealing with a freaked out customer whom she does not know...:-) Voila!  I went short, and I LOVE MY HAIR! She gave a precision cut that fit my style and face, and I have never had so many compliments on my hair. She is a truly skilled stylist (also with color), and I am grateful I was able to locate a new one who is so talented, and a joy to be around. After all these years, I have moved around alot with stylists, and loved my current one. It was dreadful to leave her, but I was blessed to have located Tonia.

when i was there i jumped on getting the awesome rugalech which are essentially rolled up small pastries that are filled with chocolate, jam, cinnamon, but chocolate is the best in my opinion.  what i regret not getting was their bubka which IS SICKENING!!!!!!!!!.  imagine a tasty egg bread (challah) filled with chocolate goo and chocolate chips and sprinkled with little bits of sugary dough.  words suck. i cant possibly describe how awesome this is.   lets just say i would take this dessert over any dessert i have ever tried in my life - over any cheesecake, over any apple pie (no contest even), over cookies, candies, even chips (love the chips).

In my opinion, Eric @ Gemsetter is the one stop shop for anyone looking to build their own ring. He is happy to work with stones you bring in, help you find the right setting, and will work around your finances in ways you'd never think possible.

I am so glad we happened upon him in our search for a gem-setter.

Broken into 3 parts, 1 fixed station for the most popular steamed items, 1 fixed station for the most popular fried items, and the traditional mobile carts comprising the 3rd part, dim sum is efficient, fast and fresh.

Some of their prices are a bit high for my budget, so I tend to take Schooner to the Gilbert Spay Neuter Clinic by my house for his vaccines, but the vets at PRAH are awesome! And they did a fabulous job in August giving Schooner's teeth a good cleaning and taking out a tooth that had started going bad. It was 20% off dental work in August so for about $250, Schooner's teeth got all cleaned up. I had to visit today to find out what Schooner did to his left hind knee. Turns out he tore his ACL. They referred me to Southwest Veterinary Surgical Service so my very active JRT could get a surgery they don't perform there at PRAH. Now to find the funds to get his ACL fixed. 

I highly recommend this veterinary practice. The vets listen well and explain everything in great detail, respectfully.",,aYPj-ctL8zpeL5-Ny8KFng

It's a little on the rich side, but very tasty. My fiancÃ© had the churro latte which is now his new favorite. If we lived closer, this place would become our go-to coffee spot. 
Just keep in mind they are in a very small space, which means there may be a wait time with your drink. Nonetheless, support local business!",,dRH2_5kJxSFcUkendyDV7A

The bathrooms were very clean. The chips and queso, especially the white cheese, were amazing. The chips alone have a very sweet/salty taste. We had a nice waiter, Ben who seemed to really know the menu and what they had to offer. Honestly the only con I can give is the curbside appeal. The restaurant sits in between houses and just not normally what you would picture as a restaurant. With that said, once you walk through the door, everything changes! Overall just a very laid back and enjoyable place to eat!",,DOG9UE2FTIRLzFH4nW9Asw

It's a really nice place with a modern country mix of decor. We were finally seated and we ordered the breakfast pizza, breakfast sandwich and pancakes. Per my daughter the bun of the breakfast sandwich was hard, ruined the sandwich as we all know that the bread can make or break the sandwich. The pizza and pancakes were good. The customer service was good. Yep, everything was good-nothing extra.

I was there for an event and I would like to go back when I can try a few more drinks. I ordered a brandy old fashion and I was not disappointed. The drink was generous in size and it tasted just like it should. The bartenders were pleasant and fast. The decor is interesting and I was glad to find regular chairs in the back because the high stools are very uncomfortable if you have short legs.

My husband and I have eaten here twice, both times have been amazing. We spent our honeymoon in Spain and visited San SebastiÃ¡n, the home of Spanish pintxos. This restaurant always reminds me of that amazing trip. The food is well executed and delicious. The last time we went we stopped in on a whim expecting to either not get seated or maybe wait for a bar seat. The staff was so accommodating, they were able to fit us in the dinning room by chance. Service is superb. Highly recommend the pickled cauliflower, amazing dish.",,5sc03tSvJ10EhK-JGKhdZw

I love the old school vibe of the Fireside lounge, it is not a pounding music blaring nightclub, its a place to hang out enjoy a drink in a comfy booth and still have a conversation or cuddle!

Hubby and I enjoyed a cocktail and appetizer platter was way more food then we could eat as a midnight snack!

Loved the Watatini (watermelon martini) very yummy! can't wait to go back and try all the rest!

The negative review apparently relates to the handling of a citation when I was at 702TRAFFIC.

I am thankful for all those who have given me their emotional, spiritual and encouraging support.  I handle misdemeanors and auto cases (since I have a medical background.

I came here while out in Phoenix for Spring Training.  It was suggested by some friends that had come earlier in the month.  I love trying new places but was scared because I had my entire family with me.  Every single person just loved their food.  

I had a combo plate with Jerk chicken, Jade chicken and Jerk fried rice.  It came with choice of beans and I suggest you get the black beans!  Delicious!!!  And a added bonus a yummy cookie.  How much better can this meal get?

Just a little warning, if you don't like spicy food pass on the jerk style.  

This was our cheapest and best meal of the entire trip!  If we would have come here first we may have eaten here everyday!!!!",,-Qvcv-wzYsWrgYyNkwC3yA

From ordering drinks to getting the check, wait time was too ridiculous. Workers were not attentive. They see us waiting and looking bored but never cared to stop by. They never came by to refill the coals. It's really not that hard to observe your customers once in a while. 

Also, the free appetizer coupon for first check-in was bogus. During my first time here, the waitress said they do not accept the coupons via phone apps anymore, and I would have to print it out and give it to them. C'mon, how is anyone supposed to know to print the coupon if it's their first time checking-in?

10992,,2012-09-10 19:51:30,,gtrVMvcqut9tAyUCPlywfA,,"I dig the Happy Dog and it's downstairs brother, Under Dog.  Happy Dog is a nice dive with tasty dogs that aren't expensive.  The beers are good and the bartenders are cool/friendly.  Sometimes they have live music, which is also fun.  Oh, and the $5 hot dogs with unlimited toppings is a huge plus.  I'm not talking about the junk hot dogs you get at dollar dog night Indian's games.  Hell, I'm not talking about the hot dogs you get at any Indians game.  These are big and plump fatties made with all beef--the kind that have some texture and actually taste good.  And the toppings menu is long and varied with awesome ingredients. One $5 dog with a slew of amazing toppings is more than enough for dinner... I promise.

While it looks a  bit like a hipster-focused dive at times, don't let that deter you.  It's not some exclusive place meant to cater to only the most stereotypical of hipsters.  Everyone is welcome and that's part of the fun.  I've seen families in the afternoons, groups of women in their 60's in the evenings, average Joes and Janes, metal heads, punk rockers, front runners, real hipsters and their less hardcore snappy-dresser-only counterparts, and all sorts of people from all sorts of walks of life.  

The Under Dog in the downstairs is also great--it's got a small bar, some old arcade games, and a sweet shuffle board table.  It reminds me of the drinking man's bars my dad would take me to as a child while he engaged int he regular maintenance of his alcoholism.  No, it's not a bad memory.  I know these sorts of places as being friendly and welcoming.  The kind of joint where you focus on your drink and the casual conversation of a few strangers you just met.

We live at the north end of Gilbert and this particular location is at the south end of town and it's worth the drive.  There is a newer location at Val Vista and Baseline however that place is a giant noisy echo chamber of a restaurant to eat in and the kitchen noise is EXCESSIVE.   I like that you can order ahead and pick up.  

The food tastes very fresh (try the baba ghanoush) and it's actually one of the few meals we buy where the food is worth it.  There is another authentic Mediterranean restaurant just a couple blocks from us, however their gyros taste nowhere near as good as Pita Jungle.
